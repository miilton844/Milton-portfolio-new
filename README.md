Deployment : --

Please notice that the deployed app might be asleep, so the first time you try to launch it will probably hang up. Dont panic!!!! :), this is an expected behaviour of the app due to it being served in a freemium model. Please try to launch again after some seconds.

This is a Coderz project challenge. In this project I have built a portfolio website where. There are 3 sections: hero, about, projects.
I've developed it with React,Typescript,styled. It uses GitHub API to get my repository information. I also use firebase (with a simple configuration which I'll update in the near future) in order to fetch additional data.

This project is actively updated.
